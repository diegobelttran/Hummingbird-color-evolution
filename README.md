# Here you will find the full dataset to reproduce our paper
Phylogenetic tree of 237 species, consensus, ultrametric (treeU.tre). Obtained from McGuire et al. 2014. Molecular Phylogenetics and the Diversification of Hummingbirds, Current Biology (2014), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.016

Standardized Brightness and chroma of 237 species of hummingbirds, males and females, for Sexual Selection patches and Natural Selection patches (dataset.txt)

Brightness and chroma evolution rates obtained from BAMM (rates_dataset.txt)

Speciation rates as the log of the Equal-Splits (DR statistic) for the same species (rates_dataset.txt)

# R code to reproduce our analyses
Using ES-sim to find an association between color evolution rates and speciation rates
